## Soup delivery food add - What's Soup

### UX 

This project is a UX school project from KYH Fronted devloper. The task was to build att delivery app for soups. It should be possible to order a soup for you or a friend.

In the ux part we did research, empathy map, flow chart, interviews and a complete prototyp in figma.

To prototyp don't have all links set, so if you try it you have to order "Chillie billie - Fried Tofu - The Cheesy On - Beetroot hummus - No pancakes - Fritz Kola. 

Prototyp: https://www.figma.com/proto/78IYpczBPdsY9d8MmKA68W/The-soup-delivery?node-id=1%3A327&scaling=min-zoom

You can see the whole figma project here:

We presented our prototypes for the teacher, who works as a UX desiger. She gaves us feed back and came with suggestions som we could improve the. I took the suggestions with me to the code project.

###
The prototype from the UX was quite big, so I had to sort things out and find the mvp. It led to that "the give-away soup" wasn't a priority.

Things to work on:
The counter when you add somethings to the shoppong cart. Right now it's not working. 

In the checkout you should be able to see which ingridients you have removed from the soup. The props is ready, but not implemented.

I think i should work with the images more, in the pop up and the checkout.

The "give away mode" should be able to the next realese. 





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
